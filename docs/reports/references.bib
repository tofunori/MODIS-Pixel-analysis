    abstract = {Abstract. Little is known about the climate sensitivity of glaciers in the Canadian Rocky Mountains due to short and discontinuous glacier mass balance records and sparse meteorological observations. In this study, we present a novel application of a distributed energy balance model with sparse glacier mass balance data to explore the climate sensitivity of a glacier in western Canada. We use a Bayesian framework to calibrate an energy balance model to geodetic mass balance estimates for Saskatchewan Glacier (52.15° N, 117.29° W), one of the main outlet glaciers of the Columbia Icefield in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Model parameters are constrained using a compilation of available metadata. The calibration procedure explores the model parameter space to identify sets of parameter values that simultaneously yield realistic (i) distributed mass balance fields, (ii) seasonal variations in melt and accumulation, and (iii) model sensitivity to given climate changes. The static mass balance sensitivity to climate was assessed for prescribed changes in regional mean air temperature between 0 and 7 °C and precipitation between -20 % and +20 %, which comprise the spread of ensemble Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) climate scenarios for the mid (2041–2070) and late (2071–2100) 21st century. Temperature sensitivity increases with warming, from -0.65 to -0.93 m w.e. a-1 °C-1, and was driven by a positive albedo feedback (44 %), followed by indirect effects of air temperature warming (24 %).},
